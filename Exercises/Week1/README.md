# D.A.L.F.O.A (Damien Accidently Left the Freezer Open Again)

The DALFOA is a device used to monitor the status of the garage freezer. After a few incidents of being left open, it became clear that it would be nice to have a system to notify the residents of the house if the freezer has been left open as well as some other things like how long it was open and what the current temperature is. This would be a great way to make sure that someone can go and close the freezer if it has been left open and decide if it got to hot for the food that was stored in there. This would save on overall costs if it was unnecessary to throw out the contents of the freezer.
